To Do:

Immediate Goals:
Make it pretty to match MoNET's main website theme.
Fix gallerypreview.js to statically load thumbnails.
Initiate Previous and Next buttons and get them working to create multiple pages of thumbnails.

Goals:
Create JS file to pull thumbnails from a database of MoNET's past paintings, have them populate the gallery thumbnails as needed.
Resize thumbnail images to appropriate length, width but preserve aspect ratio, dynamically through JS to create uniform appearance.
Link active selected thumbnail to Canvas for viewing full file; sized to  availible screen width, preserve aspect ratio. 
Create a mobile friendly version of site, or use bootstrap so that the site is smaller screen friendly.
Test and account for browser friendliness.

Might Do:
Considering ditching Canvas for Div to load static images. May keep canvas if animations of image progress are preferred. 
Perhaps use both?
Link to MoNET's colorwall, maybe have colorwall play underneath the gallery.

Future:
Perhaps institute a live feed from the robot that will display in progress images in real time, playback old images while not active?
