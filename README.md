# MoNET
Last summer, a member of the FreeCodeCamp posted he planned to create a robotic canvas.
I responded with enthusiasm and joined in the effort with LikeClockwork and another budding developer.
Most of the code is his and I ultimately felt like I have little to no ownership of the project 
because I felt like my contribution was minor and unneeded. 

Included is my failure of a gallery addition, along with test images. 

Right now I am trying to refactor his codebase in an attempt to make it more readable. 
I have no plans, as of now, to fix the gallery.

Details about the project, as well as photos and the Facebook link where more images/video are located can be seen here:
